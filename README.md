This is a PDF version of each panel of the prototype along with a .fig file for viewing. Feel free to contact me if you would like a demo or even a better PDF version for viewing. The .fig file is included for those who have Figma and would like to demo the project themselves. To do so all you need to do is save the .fig file, and import it (top right of Figma home screen), and click the play/demonstration button. For anyone unfamiliar with the tool it is essentially a prototyping tool that allows a user to assign variables, pages, and states to components without having to code out solutions. This allows users to streamline the design process and get an idea and feel of the product they want to create.
